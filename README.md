The script check.py finds the names of the customers of a company (Adroll in this case)

The script features.py scrapes data from mattermark.com based on the customers as well as the products each custormer uses
and stores them as a dictionary in adroll_customers.txt

abc.txt has the names of all the customers, if you look carefully you see that only 120 of the companies are unique, and they
get repeated periodically, this is because the website needs to give permission to your IP to view all the customers.
